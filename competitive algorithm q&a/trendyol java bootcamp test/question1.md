Write a function which given an integer N, returns the smallest integer that is greater than N and sum of those digits is equal to the sum of the digits of N

## Examples

### Example 1
Given **N = 28**, your function should return **37**. The sum of the digits of 28 is equal to **2 + 8 = 10**. The subsequent numbers are (with the sum of their digits in brackets): 29 (11), 30 (3), 31 (4), 32 (5), 33 (6), 34 (7), 35 (8), 36 (9) and 37 (10). 37 is the smallest number bigger than 28 whose digits add up to 10.
### Example 2
Given **N = 734**, your function should return **743**. The sum of the digits of 734 and 743 are equal **7+3+4=7+4+3 = 14**. No other integer between 735 and 742 adds up to 14.
### Example 3
Given **N = 1990**, your function should return **2089**. The sum of the digits of both numbers is equal to **19** and there is no other integer between them with the same sum of digits.
### Example 4 
Given **N = 1000**, your function should return **10000**. The sum of the digits of both numbers is equal to 1 and there is no other integer between them with the same sum of digits
